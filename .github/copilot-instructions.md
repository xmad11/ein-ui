# GitHub Copilot / AI Agent Instructions — Ein UI

Comprehensive, actionable guidance for GitHub Copilot and AI agents contributing to the **Ein UI** repository. This document defines not only *how* to write code, but also *how to reason about changes*, *how to document them*, and *when a task can be considered complete*.

**IMPORTANT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
A task is **NOT COMPLETE** unless **all three** of the following are true:

1. The codebase has been updated correctly.
2. User-facing or developer-facing docs are accurate.
3. **Notion documentation fully reflects the new reality of the codebase.**

If any of these are missing, the work is considered unfinished.

---

## Role Definition

You are a Copilot Agent operating inside the **Ein UI** codebase.

Your responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

* Implementing new UI components, features, and fixes
* Modifying existing components while preserving public contracts unless explicitly changing them
* Maintaining architectural and stylistic consistency across the project
* Updating documentation (local docs **and** Notion) as part of every meaningful change

You must treat documentation work as **equal in importance** to code changes.

**Source of Truth Rule:**

* The code is always the source of truth
* Notion must be updated immediately to match the code
* Documentation must never lag behind implementation

---

## Project at a Glance

**Ein UI** is a modern, registry-driven UI system built on top of Next.js and shadcn conventions.

Key characteristics:

* **Framework:** Next.js 16 using the App Router
* **Architecture:** Mixed server and client components
* **UI System:** shadcn-style component registry
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first)
* **Composition:** Radix UI primitives + `class-variance-authority` (CVA)
* **Utilities:** `cn` helper from `/lib/utils.ts` (clsx + tailwind-merge)

Code layout overview:

* **Main application:** `app/`
* **Registry manifest:** `registry.json`
* **Registry implementations:** `registry/`
* **Component docs:** `app/docs/components/`

Registry groups currently include:

* `liquid-glass`
* `innovative`
* `widgets`
* `blocks`

## Key Workflows & Commands

Use the following commands during development. These are considered part of the normal workflow and should be run before opening a PR.

* **Local development:**

  ```bash
  pnpm dev
  ```

  Runs the Next.js app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

* **Production build:**

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

* **Production start:**

  ```bash
  pnpm start
  ```

* **Linting:**

  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```

* **Registry tooling:**

  ```bash
  pnpm registry:build
  pnpm registry:search
  ```

  Used for validating and inspecting registry entries via the shadcn CLI.

* **Bundle analysis:**

  ```bash
  pnpm analyze
  ```

## 🚨 Mandatory Notion Sync Rules (DO NOT SKIP)

Updating Notion is **mandatory**, not optional. You **MUST** update Notion whenever a change alters behavior, usage, or understanding of the system.

### Changes That REQUIRE Notion Updates

#### UI & Code Changes

* Adding a new component or variant
* Changing component props, defaults, or behavior
* Visual changes that affect appearance or interaction
* Refactors that alter responsibility, ownership, or public APIs
* Performance optimizations that change runtime behavior

#### Registry & Documentation Changes

* Any change to `registry.json`
* Adding, removing, or updating `dependencies` or `registryDependencies`
* Adding or modifying component documentation pages
* Changes to CLI install instructions or usage patterns

#### Configuration, Tooling & Infra

* Environment variable additions, removals, or meaning changes
* Build, lint, or tooling updates
* Dependency upgrades or removals that affect consumers

👉 **If a developer or user would notice the difference, Notion MUST be updated.**

---

## What Must Be Updated in Notion (Per Change)

Every Notion update should be explicit, structured, and future-proof. Assume a new developer will read it months later without context.

### 1. Change Summary

* Clear description of what changed
* The motivation behind the change
* The problem or limitation it addresses

### 2. Technical Details

* Files, folders, or modules affected
* Component names, hooks, or APIs involved
* Clear before vs after behavior when relevant

### 3. Impact Assessment

* Who is affected (library consumers, internal devs, end users)
* Whether the change is breaking or backward-compatible
* Accessibility, performance, or DX implications

### 4. Required Actions

* New or updated install steps
* Registry dependency updates
* Migration steps or upgrade guidance

---

## Expected Notion Structure

Copilot Agents should assume the following high-level structure exists in Notion and keep it accurate:

* **Architecture**

  * Component system overview
  * Registry architecture and distribution model

* **Components**

  * One page per major component
  * Props, variants, examples, and constraints

* **Registry & CLI**

  * `registry.json` schema and conventions
  * Dependency and compatibility rules

* **Changelog**

  * Chronological record of changes
  * Entries linked to PRs or commits

If an appropriate page does not exist, **CREATE IT**.

---

## Changelog Enforcement

Every meaningful change MUST result in a Changelog update.

Each entry must include:

* Date of change
* Short, descriptive title
* Change type: `feature | fix | refactor | docs | config`
* One concise paragraph explaining the change
* Links to:

  * Relevant component or architecture pages
  * The associated PR or commit (when available)

---

## Important Conventions (DO NOT BREAK)

These conventions ensure consistency and registry compatibility:

* Always use the path alias `@/*` (configured in `tsconfig.json`)
* Registry component files use **kebab-case** naming (e.g., `glass-dock.tsx`)
* Export **named components only** (no default exports)
* Add `"use client"` at the top of files that use hooks, state, or DOM APIs
* Styling rules:

  * Prefer Tailwind utility classes
  * Use `cva` for variants and composability
  * Use `cn(...)` to merge classes safely
* Component documentation must live under:

  ```
  app/docs/components/<slug>/page.tsx
  ```

---

## Adding or Updating a Component (Step-by-Step)

Follow this process strictly when working with components:

1. **Implement the component**

   * Location:

     ```
     registry/<group>/<component>.tsx
     ```
   * Strongly typed props
   * Named export only
   * Set `displayName` for React DevTools

2. **Update `registry.json`**

   * Define `name`, `type`, `title`, and `description`
   * Declare all required `dependencies`
   * Add `registryDependencies` when relying on other registry items
   * Ensure file paths are correct and relative to repo root

3. **Add or update documentation**

   * Location:

     ```
     app/docs/components/<slug>/page.tsx
     ```
   * Must include:

     * `PageHeader`
     * `CLIInstall componentName="<name>"`
     * At least one `ComponentPreview`
     * Correct import examples, such as:

       ```ts
       import { GlassDock } from "@/registry/innovative/glass-dock";
       ```

4. **Run validation commands**

   * `pnpm lint`
   * `pnpm build`
   * `pnpm registry:build` (when registry changes)

5. **Update Notion** (mandatory, blocking step)

---

## Patterns & Idioms

Preferred patterns across the codebase:

* Export reusable types for consumers and docs
* Keep interactivity isolated to client components
* Extract shared logic into small, focused hooks
* Use `lucide-react` icons passed as JSX props
* Follow accessibility best practices (`aria-*`, semantic roles)

---

## Avoid Common Mistakes

* Forgetting `"use client"` in interactive components
* Missing or incorrect registry dependency declarations
* Updating code without updating docs or Notion
* Writing vague or low-signal changelog entries

---

## Tests & Quality Expectations

* The project relies on TypeScript and ESLint for correctness
* Add tests when component behavior is non-trivial or stateful
* Always update docs and Notion alongside behavioral changes

---

## Helpful Files & Directories

Frequently referenced files include:

* `package.json` (scripts and tooling)
* `tsconfig.json` (path aliases and TS config)
* `registry.json` (registry manifest)
* `registry/` (component implementations)
* `app/docs/components/*` (component documentation)
* `components/docs/*` (docs helpers)
* `lib/utils.ts` (`cn` helper)

---

## Completion Checklist (BLOCKING)

Before marking any task as complete, verify:

* [ ] Code follows Ein UI conventions and patterns
* [ ] Component and docs pages are updated if applicable
* [ ] Notion accurately reflects current behavior
* [ ] No outdated or misleading documentation remains
* [ ] Changelog entry has been added

If **any** item is unchecked, the task is **INCOMPLETE**.

---

## Final Rule

**Documentation is not optional.**

Code change = Docs change = Notion change.

Copilot Agents must enforce these rules strictly in **Ein UI**.
