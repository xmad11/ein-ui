Welcome! Ein UI is a collection of beautiful, ready-made "liquid glass" components that you can preview, copy, and use in your website or app. This guide explains how to preview the components, get code snippets, and add a component to your project — no developer knowledge required.

✅ Great for: designers and frontend developers who want shareable, copy-and-paste UI components
with consistent design patterns and built-in accessibility.

---

## Key features

- Collection of handcrafted, accessible components built on top of Radix UI primitives and
  Tailwind CSS v4 (TypeScript + React 19).
- Components are distributed using the shadcn registry format — components are easy to install
  into other projects using the `shadcn` CLI.
- Built-in documentation site and component previews (Next.js 16 + app router)
- Example page templates / blocks (e.g., Admin Panel) to showcase layout patterns.
- Zod validation examples and server/client component patterns for modern full-stack apps.

## Quick links

- **Preview docs**: [Live preview](https://ui.eindev.ir)
- **Registry JSON**: [Registry JSON](/r/registry.json)
- **Try components**: For details, see `app/docs/components/*`

cd ein-ui-shadcn-register
```

2 Install dependencies

```bash
# using pnpm
pnpm install

# or using npm
npm install

# or yarn
yarn install
```

3 Run development server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or npm run dev
# App runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Using Next.js 16.1.0 bundle analyzer

To analyze your Next.js bundle, you can use the built-in experimental analyzer:

```bash
pnpm analyze
# or npm run analyze
```

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the issue and PR templates when submitting work.

- Run `pnpm lint` to check code style
- New components should include comprehensive examples under `app/docs/components/*` and should declare any required `dependencies` in `registry.json`

Where to find guidance:

- Docs pages in the repo (`https://ui.eindev.ir/docs`) include live previews and code snippets.
- Use `shadcn` registry format to make your component discoverable via the CLI.
